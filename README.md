Overview:  
This is a React.js project focused on building and validating forms. The app includes fields for a user's name, email, and phone number. The main goal is to practice input handling, real time validation, and component structure in a React app.

How the Application Works:

1. The main component (`App.js`) renders the form and manages its layout.
2. A child component (`BasicForm.js`) contains the form structure and handles field updates.
3. Validation is done both at the field level (live input feedback) and form level (on submission).
4. Fields must be correctly filled to submit: 
   - Name must not be empty.
   - Email must be in a valid format (with "@").
   - Phone must contain digits only.

Running the Application:

1. Youâ€™ll need Node.js and Git installed on your computer.
2. Download the project:
   - `git clone https://github.com/ivan-newton/forms-homework.git`
   - `cd forms-homework`

3. Install dependencies:
   - `npm install`

4. Start the project:
   - `npm start`

5. Open your browser to view the app:
   - `http://localhost:3000`
